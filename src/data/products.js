These dogs are known for their fluffy appearance and their bushy tail that curls over their back. They have dark eyes and a distinctive expression that can range from alert to mischievous.

    These dogs are intelligent, agile, and often excel in various dog sports and activities. They are friendly, loyal, and enjoy being around people, making them good family companions. They tend to get along well with children and other pets, but proper socialization is important.
